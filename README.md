# FashionMNIST_PyTorch_DATS_6203_11

The objective of this exam is to become familiar with PyTorch for training deep networks on large datasets. You will be provided with a sample program that loads in the Fashion MNIST data set and sets up a simple multilayer network to be trained on it.

(See https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist for a description of the data set and a list of various efforts to train on it.) The instructions below provide a rough framework of what you should do for the exam. You should experiment with using PyTorch on this large dataset. The project is open-ended. The goal is to learn as much as you can about using deep multilayer networks, and to communicate what you have learned in your project report.
